<p>The rating system is an elo rating system.<br />
This is a method in which a player’s rating is calculated based on his previous experience.</p>
<div id="new-players" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>New players</strong></h4>
<p>New players are given a rating of 750.<br />
Consequently, new players are not at the bottom of the ranking although they are not ranked too high either!</p>
</div>
<div id="update-the-rating" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Update the rating</strong></h4>
<p>A player’s rank is updated taking into account the rank of the opponent. For example, a highly ranked player plays against a lowly ranked player.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the highly ranked player wins: his rating is increased by a small amount</li>
<li>If the lowly ranked player wins: his rating is increased by a huge amount</li>
</ul>
<p>The updating of the rating consists of the following steps:</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Step 1</strong></h5>
<p>Assume a player has rating <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and the opponent has rating <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>.<br />
Calculate the expected score of the player as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E_{R} =  \frac{1}{1+10^{-(R-R_i)/400}} \]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Step 2</strong></h5>
<p>The rank of the player is updated based on parameters <em>K</em> and <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>The parameter <em>K</em> is factor that determines how much the ratings will change:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}     
        32 \quad \text{if $R &lt; 2100$}\\     
        24 \quad \text{if $2100 &lt; R &lt;2400$}\\     
        16 \quad \text{if $R &gt; 2400$}\\  
\end{array} 
\right.
\]</span></p>
<p>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> represents the score, taking into account the result of the petanque game:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 S = \left\{  
 \begin{array}{l}     
    0 \quad \text{for a loss}\\     
    1 \quad \text{for a win}+\left\{  
\begin{array}{l}          0.0 \quad \text{if petanque score = 1}\\         
                          0.3 \quad \text{if petanque score = 2}\\
                          0.6 \quad \text{if petanque score = 3}\\ 
                          \end{array}
\right. 
\end{array} 
\right. 
\]</span></p>
<p>The rating of the player is updated by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R^{&#39;} = R + K \cdot (S - E_{R})\]</span></p>
<p>Game on!</p>
